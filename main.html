	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>Time Complexity</strong>is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. 
        It helps us determine how <strong>efficient</strong> an algorithm is and provides insights into its scalability.
	</p>
	<p>
		Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. 
        It is crucial to analyze <b>Space Complexity</b>, especially when working with limited resources. 
        A common example is when an algorithm has a space complexity of <strong>O(n)</strong>
